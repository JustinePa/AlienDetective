# Land polygons
The needed files for loading the land polygons in script `1_Calculation_sea_distances_2025.R` are to large to store on GitHub.  
But they can be downloaded from [this webpage](https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/data/land-polygons.html).  
Download the first file: **Projection WGS84, Large polygons not split**.  

Only these 2 files will be used:  
- land_polygons.shp
- land_polygons.shx
