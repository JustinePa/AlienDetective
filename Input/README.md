# Land polygons
The needed files for loading the land polygons in scripts `1_Calculation_sea_distances_2025.R` and `1.Calculations.R` are to large to store on GitHub.  
But they can be downloaded from [this webpage](https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/data/land-polygons.html).  
Download the first file: **Projection WGS84, Large polygons not split**.  
This will download a zipfolder.  
Unzip the folder and place all the files (except the `README.md`) in this location: **`Input/land_polygons`**.
